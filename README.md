# Loan Prediction Using ML And Python

# Aim

Our aim in this project is to make use of pandas, matplotlib, & seaborn libraries of python to extract insights from the data and xgboost, & scikit-learn libraries for ML.
And, to learnig the use of Xgboost in Machine Learning.

And, predict whether the loan applicant can replay the loan or not using voting ensembling techniques of combining the predictions from machine learning algorithms.


## Attributes in the dataset

Loan id, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self Employed, Applicant income, Coapplicant income, Loan Amount,Credit History, Property_Area, Loan_Status
